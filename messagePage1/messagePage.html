Dear John,

I hope you are doing well. My name is Sutharsika Kumar, and I am a sophomore studying computer science and mathematics at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am simply writing to express my interest in learning about your experience as a Systems Engineer at Marotta Controls.

As someone exploring a career in AI and robotics, I find your work with MBSE and underwater robotics particularly fascinating. I'd love to learn more about how you have seen the field evolve over the past few years and how you believe it will change in the coming years.

Would you be willing to connect for a brief call or coffee in the coming weeks? I would greatly appreciate your guidance and advice as I navigate my academic and professional path. I have attached my resume for you to look over, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Sutharsika Kumar
