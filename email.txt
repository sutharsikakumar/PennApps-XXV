Dear Lei,

I hope you're doing well. 

I'm John, a sophomore studying data analytics at Harvard University. I'm writing to inquire about your availability for a short call in the coming weeks to hear about your experience at EY and how you got into data science. 

As someone unsure about the best way to start a career in data science after completing my undergraduate studies, advice from someone with so much experience would be amazing. I'd love to learn more about your projects at EY and how you've approached them from a data analysis perspective. 

I have attached my resume for you to look over, and I would gladly work around your schedule to find a time that fits. 

I'm looking forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great rest of your week! 

Best regards, 
John Doe
