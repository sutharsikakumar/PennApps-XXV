Dear Lei, 

I hope you are doing well. 

My name is Sutharsika Kumar, and I am a sophomore at Harvard College. I am writing to inquire about your availability for a quick call or coffee in the coming weeks to discuss your experience in data science and cybersecurity consulting at EY Financial Services. 

As someone still exploring various pathways in data science, advice from someone with work experience would be invaluable. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data protection, privacy compliance, and data management in the financial sector. 

I have attached my resume for your reference, and I would gladly work around your schedule to find a time that fits. 

I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great week! 

Sincerely, 
Sutharsika Kumar
