Dear Birks, 

I hope you are doing well. 

My name is Aarav Jindal, and I am a sophomore at New York University, studying Computer Science. I would like to know your availability for a quick call or coffee in the coming weeks to discuss your experience at Salesforce and your journey as a Data Science intern. 

As someone still exploring his options for a career in software development, having your insights will be incredibly valuable. I'd love to learn more about how you transitioned from studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science to pursuing a career in software development and also how you have seen the demand for software engineers from a field like electrical engineering and computer science grow in recent years. 

I have attached my resume for you to look over, and I would gladly work around your schedule to find a time that fits. Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards,
Aarav Jindal
