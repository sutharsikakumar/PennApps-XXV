Dear Birks, 

I hope you are doing well. 

My name is Aarav Jindal, and I am a sophomore at Princeton studying electrical engineering and computer science. 

I am writing to inquire about your availability for a quick call or coffee in the coming weeks to hear about your experience as a software engineer at Salesforce. 

As someone uncertain about the best way to start a career in software development, advice from someone with so much experience would be invaluable. I am particularly interested in learning more about how you transitioned from studying electrical engineering and computer science to a career in software engineering. 

I am attaching my resume for your reference. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a great week! 

Best regards, 
Aarav Jindal
