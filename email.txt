Dear Lei, 

I hope you are doing well. 

My name is Sutharsika Kumar, and I am a sophomore at Harvard University, studying Data Science. I would like to know your availability for a quick call to discuss your career journey in Technology Consulting and your experience as a Consultant at EY. As someone unsure about the best way to start a career in Data Science and Technology Consulting, advice from your perspective would be invaluable. 

As someone who aspires to combine data analytics with international relations, your experience in Financial Services and Cybersecurity is particularly inspiring. I would love to learn more about your work in data classification for insurance companies and your involvement in projects like cross-border data transfer and third-party security assessment. 

You can find my resume attached for your reference. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect and learn from your experience. 

Sincerely, 
Sutharsika Kumar
