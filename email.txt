Dear Birks, 

I hope you're doing well. 

My name is John Doe, and I am a sophomore at Harvard studying computer science and mathematics. I am writing to inquire about your availability for a quick call or coffee in the coming weeks to hear about your experiences as a software engineer at Salesforce and learn more about your work as a member of the technical staff. 

I am particularly interested in exploring a career in data science and would love to hear about your transition into this field. Your experience working with renewable energy systems and solar payments software (at SunPower and ClimateCardinals) is impressive. I would love to know more about how you came to focus your career in software development and what advice you would give to someone just starting out. 

I am attaching my resume for you to look over, and I would be happy to work around your schedule to find a time that fits. 

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely, 

John Doe
